# EBCM-ConfigurationModel

> Objective :

The aim of this work is to implement EBCM models in Kendrick.  For this fact, we are interested in the configuration model from the degree distributions (homogeneous, fish, bimodal and powerlaw) as illustrated in the right part of figure 4 of the work of [(Miller et al., 2012)](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsif.2011.0403#d3e737).

Here we implement the EBCM configuration model from different degree distributions in Python and [Kendrick](https://github.com/KendrickOrg/kendrick).
